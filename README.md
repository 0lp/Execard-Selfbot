# EXECARD SELFBOT:

# Setup
- go to https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/ and download that. When downloading, check the `Add Python to PATH` box
- Then download the ZIP file and Extract it using Winrar. 
- Then launch discord. 
- Then copy this code: 

var req=webpackJsonp.push([[],{extra_id:(e,r,t)=>e.exports=t},[["extra_id"]]]);for(let e in req.c)if(req.c.hasOwnProperty(e)){let r=req.c[e].exports;if(r&&r.__esModule&&r.default)for(let e in r.default)"getToken"===e&&console.log(r.default.getToken())}
- Then when you are on discord press ctrl+shift+I
- Then navigate to the console tab
- Then paste that code in the console tab
- Then a string of numbers and letters should pop up. Copy that
- Then close discord
- Then go to the file you extracted
- Then click on config.json
- Then go to the `Token-Here` area
- Then paste the long code there
- Then go to the `Password-Here` area
- Then put in your password there {optional}
- Then save config.json
- Then go to `install.bat` and run it
- Then go to `launch.bat` and run it
- Then if it works say `yey` 
- Then if it does not go to Main.py
- Then if it works say `yey`
- Then if it does not work make sure you installed python correctly and you must have `discord` named as `discord` in program files. you need to have DISCORD!! no other clients are supported (Lightcord users realising their discord is just Bandaged BD with some other stuff that can be reuced to plugins. Don't use lightcord. It crashes 15x on startup and laggy, Themes partly work, made by 2 children and Powercord is the best client mod.). if it doesn't work contact `Jеаnсуs#7361` Copy paste that becuase those are Cyrillyc and Greek characters that look like english.

# Q&A
- Q: **`SSL Certificate Error`**
- A: Just install [CRT File](https://crt.sh/?id=2835394). Then run it and install. (This is common and it was a certificate that expired May 30th 2020. But a new one came out so install it.). If you wanna go into further detail then head to [SITE](https://support.sectigo.com/Com_KnowledgeDetailPage?Id=kA03l00000117LT).  
- Q: **`Module Missing`**
- A: Just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in console. This insures that all modules required for Alucard are installed and up to date!
- Q: **`Windll not found`**
- A: Alucard uses some windows features from modules. Example windll from ctypes. windll is used to add the console title. You can remove the title setters in-order to fix it.
- Q: **`TypeError: __new__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'deny_new'`**
- A: This error occured on an old installation of discord.py to fix simply run :`pip install -U discord.py` this updates discord.py!
